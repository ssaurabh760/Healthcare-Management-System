**** FINAL PROJECT :  Health Care Management System ****

Health Care Management System using Java Swing
Abstract:
The Health Care Management System (HMS) is designed to streamline and automate the operations of a multispecialty hospital. This system aims to efficiently manage hospital resources, patient records, inventory supplies, appointments, and overall hospital administration. The solution involves four enterprise modules, each serving a specific purpose, and seven organizations with distinct roles contributing to the seamless functioning of the hospital.
